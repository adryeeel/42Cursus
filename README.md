# 42Cursus

This repository tracks my journey through the 42 common core and piscine curriculum. Follow along as I tackle the challenges and milestones of the 42cursus, documenting my progress in this README. From mastering the basics to diving into advanced topics, this repository serves as a map of my learning adventure.

## The 42 experience

What expect from a 42 school? Well... here we go:

- **Self-Directed Learning**: At 42, learning is self-directed. There are no traditional teachers or formal lectures. Instead, we are given access to resources like online tutorials, project specifications, and some reference materials. We are responsible for managing our own learning journey. We code our future.

- **Peer Learning**: Collaboration and peer learning are fundamental at 42. We work together, help each other, and learn from one another. This fosters a sense of community and encourages teamwork, which are essential skills in the tech industry.

- **Project-Based Learning**: The curriculum is heavily project-based. We learn by working on real-world projects that become progressively more challenging as they advance through the course. The projects are designed to cover a wide range of topics and technologies, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of computer science fundamentals.

- **Mandatory Projects**: There are mandatory projects that students must complete to progress through the common core curriculum. These projects are designed to cover key concepts and skills. They must be completed within a certain timeframe and meet very rigorous specified requirements.

- **Peer Evaluation**: After completing a project, students undergo peer evaluation where their peers provide feedback on their work. This feedback is crucial for learning and improvement.

- **No Formal Grades**: Unlike traditional educational institutions, 42 does not use grades or exams to assess students' progress. Instead, advancement is based on completing projects and meeting certain competency criteria.

- **Iterative Learning**: Students often redo projects multiple times to improve their skills and understanding. This iterative approach allows for continuous learning and refinement of skills.

Do you think you can handle this? 😉

## 🏊 Piscine

_Piscine_ is a French term meaning "swimming pool" that refers to a intensive and immersive programming boot camp that serves as the entry point to 42 school course.

During the piscine, prospective students, known as "pisciners", undergo a rigorous four to six-week evaluation period where they are introduced to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving. The piscine is designed to identify individuals with the potential to excel in the field of computer science, regardless of their background or prior experience.

I undertook the #7 C piscine at 42 Porto, which took place on 2023/08. I improved my skills and achieved remarkable feats throughout this enriching journey. Notably, I secured the 2nd position in my piscine cohort, significantly bolstering my coalition's success as we emerged victorious in the boot camp.

I have a very special repository where I documented all my experience and perfomance at 42 Porto piscine. You can access it [here](https://github.com/adryeeel/42Piscine) 😉.

## Common core

The 42 common core features a ranked-based system that tailors project difficulty to your skill level.

As you progress through the curriculum and achieve higher ranks, you'll tackle projects specifically crafted to challenge and expand your abilities. This dynamic approach ensures that each project is finely tuned to match your current expertise, providing an optimized learning experience at every stage of our journey.

Below is mine.
